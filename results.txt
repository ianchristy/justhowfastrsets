 what is the fastest way to check if a string is all the same char ? 
 in this case I am testing for a string of all zeros
 but you could just as easily use the first char,  s[0]

 repeated the same test, ten thousand times to get the run-times up there

# for loop
time python a.py > /dev/null 

    real    0m0.114s
    user    0m0.095s
    sys     0m0.013s

# convert list to a set
time python b.py > /dev/null 

    real    0m0.072s     <-- 53% faster than a.py 
    user    0m0.055s
    sys     0m0.011s


# one line lamda function
time python c.py > /dev/null 

    real    0m0.123s
    user    0m0.106s
    sys     0m0.011s

# from collections import Counter
time python d.py > /dev/null 

    real    0m0.147s
    user    0m0.127s
    sys     0m0.011s
